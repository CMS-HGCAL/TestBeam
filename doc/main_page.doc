\section INPUTS_ Input files:
 - channel mapping: file that contains the conversion between electronicID (SKIROC chip number) to detector ID (DetId)
   - \verbatim HGCal/CondObjects/data/map_FNAL_2.txt \endverbatim
 - pedestals: pedestal values measured from pedestal run with dedicated analysis (see PEDESTAL_ANALYSIS_)
   - \verbatim HGCal/CondObjects/data/Ped_HighGain_8272_Mean.txt \endverbatim
 - gains: ADCtoGeV conversion factors measured with dedicated analysis (see ADCTOGEV_)
   - \verbatim N/A yet \endverbatim

Pedestals and ADCtoGeV should be provided for both high gain ADC and low gain ADC.
Now only pedestals for high gain is available. Default values if files are not provided are:
 - 0 for pedestals
 - 1 for ADCtoGeV

\section RECO_ Reconstruction sequence
The reconstruction sequences are defined in StandardSequences/python
 - RawToDigiSeq
 - LocalRecoSeq


\section DQM_ Running the DQM plotting
 
Currently the DQM worflow kicks in post the creation of Digis and also after the creation of RecHits.
 - Post Digi we can monitor:
    - adc counts in each cell of a sensor per sample, per layer(summed over the events).
    - 1D adc distributions per cell(per layer, per sample).
 - Post RecHit we can monitor:
    -  RecHits(GeV) in each cell of a sensor, per layer(summed over the events).
    -  The Occupancy(defined as RecHits above a certain threshold) in each cell of a sensor, per layer(summed over the events).
    -  1D RecHits distributions per cell(per layer, per sample).
    -  1D RecHits distributions summed over all cells in a layer(per layer).

On executing:
\verbatim
cmsRun test_cfg.py
\endverbatim

a root file \b test_DigiAndRechitPlotter_TB.root is produced. This file has two directories namely 
 - \b hgcaltbdigisplotter: with the Digi->DQM workflow 
 - \b hgcaltbrechitsplotter: with the RecHits to DQM workflow

In the Digi->DQM workflow the following histograms may be found:
 - (TH2Poly) FullLayer_Sample#M_Layer#N is the cumulative(over events) adc count in cells of the sensor in the #N layer for the #M sample.
 - (TH1F) Cell_u_#P_v_#Q_Sample#M_Layer#N is the 1D adc spectrum for the sample #M in a cell in layer #N marked by u=#P and v=#Q in the local(u,v) co-ordinate system of the cells in a sensor(Not to be confused with the Sensor_U, Sensor_V used to identify sensors in a layer).

In the RecHits->DQM workflow the following histograms may be found:
 - (TH2Poly) FullLayer_RecHits_Layer#N is the cumulative(over events) RecHits in cells of the sensor in the #N layer
 - (TH2Poly) FullLayer_Occupancy_Layer#N is the cumulative Occupancy(as defined above) in cells of the sensor in the #N layer
 - (TH1F) Cell_RecHits_u_#P_v_#Q_Layer#N is the 1D RecHits spectrum for a cell in layer #N marked by u=#P and v=#Q in the local(u,v) co-ordinate system of the cells in a sensor
 - (TH1F) FullLayer_RecHits_Layer#N_Summed same as above but summed over all cells in a sensor.
