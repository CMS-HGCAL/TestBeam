The relevant dE/dx weights used for energy reconstruction
may be found in the files named samplingfactors.list under the relevant
sub-folders for the June and October EE configurations.

These are the "averaged dE/dx" weights which is there in the second column
of this file for the corresponding layer mentioned in the first column. The 
units are in MeV/MIP.
These have been derived based on the material description summarized in the file
materials.list mentioned in the same folder.

More details on these weights may be found in Arabella's presentation:-
